You can create collections -> then folders -> then req
Variables can be declared in th edit section of collections.folders or requests and passed with following notation {{variable}}
Global variables can be also decalred
Environments can be set and variables can be declared to the req passing and also to the body

In built tests are available in the Test section
In collection level theres Run where we can run the tests selecting the environment with no of repetitions as well

All these tests can be run from cmd(newman is cmd runner for postman)

2.Install new man -> npm install -g newman
3.Export the collection containg the request to a desired folders
4.Open cmd and cd to the json file directory
